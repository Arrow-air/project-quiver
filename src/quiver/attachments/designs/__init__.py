"""Community attachment designs.

This package is a home for payload attachment designs that mount to the
Quiver's three quick-release interfaces (bottom, left, right). Each
design should be its own subpackage with an assembly.py and steps/ dir.

Example structure:
    designs/
        lidar_mount/
            __init__.py
            assembly.py
            steps/
                bracket.step
