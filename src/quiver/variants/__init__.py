"""Drone variants - major structural modifications.

This package is a home for variant Quiver builds that significantly
differ from the base PT3 design. Each variant should be its own
subpackage following the same subassembly pattern.

Example structure:
    variants/
        heavy_lift/
            __init__.py
            assembly.py
            frame/
                assembly.py
                steps/
