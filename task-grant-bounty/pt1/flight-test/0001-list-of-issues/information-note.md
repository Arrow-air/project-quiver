# Project Description

Project Quiver – Prototype 1 (PT1) underwent a comprehensive flight log review as part of its ongoing development and flight validation process. The goal of this phase was to evaluate PT1's performance under various flight conditions by manually reviewing all available flight test logs. This preliminary analysis is intended to identify potential issues for further investigation and to support the next stages of tuning and flight control refinement.

# Methodology

Each individual log file was manually sorted and thoroughly examined. Specific focus areas included:

- Flight modes and their transitions  
- Duration of each flight and executed maneuvers  
- Vibration levels during operation  
- GPS performance and satellite fix quality  
- EKF (Extended Kalman Filter) status, including any resets  
- Battery voltage consistency and ESC (Electronic Speed Controller) readings  
- General behavior of the flight controller  
- Trends in motor output signals  
- Additional general observations relevant to flight performance

Key findings and recurring patterns were documented throughout the review process. A summary table was prepared to consolidate the results, and it will also be shared in `.xlsx` format for future reference.

# Results and Deliverables

The review yielded several recurring issues requiring further investigation:


### 1. ESC0 Voltage Discrepancy

In all examined flights, the voltage reading from **ESC0** consistently appears approximately **0.5V lower** than that of the other ESCs and the main battery voltage. This may indicate a **sensor offset or measurement error**, and further investigation is required to confirm its cause and impact.

### 2. Motor Output Divergence

In some tests, particularly **while on the ground** and occasionally during **yaw inputs in flight**, motor outputs show **significant divergence** and in a small number of tests **hitting the motor limits**. These deviations may point to control imbalance or tuning inconsistencies.

### 3. Ground Resonance on Landing

Ground resonance phenomena were observed during **landings**, particularly during the **March 22, 2025** tests. This effect was **mostly seen in AUTO mode** and **to a lesser extent in POS mode**. These events should be reviewed in connection with landing gear dynamics and control system behavior near touchdown.


### 4. Oscillations and Tracking Deficiency in POS and AUTO Modes

Minor **oscillatory behavior** was noted in **Position Hold (POS)** and **AUTO** modes. Additionally, it was observed that **actual control parameters do not follow the target values as precisely as in STABILIZE mode**. A noticeable **altitude loss during the deceleration phase** suggests that both the **inner-most and outer-loop controllers** may require **further tuning**, which can be effectively performed using the existing flight test data. Although it appears to be better in the later tests, a suitable gain set should be utilized.


### 5. EKF Yaw Resets

**EKF yaw resets** were detected in **every test log**. While some yaw resets may occur under normal conditions, this recurring behavior warrants further analysis to ensure there is **no underlying issue being masked**, such as magnetic interference, poor GPS heading initialization, or insufficient yaw observability.

### 6. Yaw Reference Initialization Offset

In a small number of tests, the **initial yaw reference value** was found to be slightly offset from the **actual yaw angle**. Although observed infrequently, this inconsistency should be examined to ensure proper heading alignment during mission-critical operations.

A detailed summary table of all log file reviews can be found at the end of this document and is also available as an `.xlsx` file in the project folder.


# Remarks

The manual review of PT1’s flight logs has provided valuable insights into recurring issues and performance trends. While the overall system shows promising behavior, several areas require further analysis and tuning, particularly in relation to ESC readings, yaw stability, and controller performance in autonomous modes. The observations made during this phase will directly inform the upcoming test campaigns and system refinements.
