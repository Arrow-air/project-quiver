# Project Description

This information note will cover the design choices, requirements, and spec for the PT3 PCBs.

# Methodology

Discussions around PT3 baseline designs were started on May5th, 2025 and documented via [recording](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gKChez0KID_fH9h32p80YMG8lpvG8C8I/view?usp=drive_link) and [FigJam Board](https://www.figma.com/board/SU1d7bKC6t5i6ATU0lYqLt/PT3-Baseline-Design-Discussion?node-id=1-1034&t=OotsqhjERJzCrPtP-0). This review revealed the need for a deeper discussion around PT3's PCB design and electrical architecture. 

This information note will cover the design choices made  over the course of two calls on May 6-7, 2025. For a detail review of the conversations, listen to the recordings.

[Day 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PiIob_eGq5ElMCwGZTUeyg_mtlkL63G9/view?usp=drive_link) - Reviewing relevant Quiver requirements and PT 1.5 & PT 2 PCBs.

[Day 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p_hfNhdg6mo9MM4S5YFZBDAfLjT9-_I8/view?usp=drive_link) - Deciding on components and upgrades
