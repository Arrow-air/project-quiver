# Main PCB & Battery Control PCB Wiring Harness Manufacturing Guide

## Purpose

This guide explains how to manufacture and assemble the wiring harnesses for both:

- The **Main PCB**, which handles core avionics and power distribution.
- The **Battery Control PCB (BC_PCB)**, which interfaces with the Main PCB and pushbutton systems.

Use the following wiring table for all of the connections TO/FROM for all of PT3â€™s systems: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1INDpDhqC1wYGbbJhMCmYZ-2Rzxx5Ob4zoG5JTc_2Sps/edit?gid=2139598833#gid=2139598833

## Manufacturing Instructions

### 1. Wire Cutting

- Cut wires to specified lengths (in cm) from the wiring table.
- No strain relief required since the lengths do not take the connectors into account and some lengths were rounded up.

### 2. Crimping

- Strip approximately 2 mm of insulation for 20 - 26 AWG cables
- Strip approximately 9 mm of insulation for 6 AWG cables
    - Do not double crimp and apply heat shrink if necessary
- Use appropriate crimp tool for terminals
- Verify both conductor and insulation are captured securely.

### 3. Connector Assembly

- Insert crimped wires into JST, Molex, or Phoenix housings per the wiring diagram.
- Match **pin numbers** at both ends of the cable using the table.
- Ensure proper keying and orientation

### 4. Continuity Testing

- Perform multimeter continuity checks for each wire.
- Verify no shorts or open wires exist.

### 5. Harness Bundling

- Use mesh sleeving, zip ties, and cable clips.
- Route for minimal EMI, avoiding parallel runs of HV and signal cables.
