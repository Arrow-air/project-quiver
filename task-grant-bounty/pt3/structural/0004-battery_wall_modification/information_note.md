# Project Description

This information note covers two corrective modifications on the battery wall that were identified during the assembly of PT3.

**Battery Slider Hole Misalignment:** The battery walls were originally ordered as symmetrical parts; however, they were not symmetric on the design. During tne assembly, this asymmetry created inconsistency and installation issues, as one side was missing the hole required for the battery slider part. 

**Motor Arm Connector Bolt Installation Cutouts:** The cutouts on the battery wall that were intended to leave enough space for one of the motor arm connector bolts were not sufficient. The restricted clearance complicated assembly and risked improper fastening.

# Methodology

Fusion 360 is used to make the necessary changes on the main assembly.
