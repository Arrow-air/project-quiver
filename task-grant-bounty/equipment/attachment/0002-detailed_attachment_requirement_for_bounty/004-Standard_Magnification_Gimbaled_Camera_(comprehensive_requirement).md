# Comprehensive Requirement
### Standard Magnification Gimbaled Camera
Version: 14.05.25-1 Boar

## General Objective Description:

A gimbal stablized camera system with two sensors, it contains a main normal photograph lens and a high magnification lens, both are fixed focus. Instead of controlling a single complex optical zooming lens, this camera can just switch between two different zooming via some kind of digital video switching mechanism.

## Optional Functions:

## Architecture & Boundary:
- Must connect to aircraft's video transmitting system
- Must have the ability to switch the video transmitting feed between two sensors.
- Shall paired with 3 axis gimbal with vibration canceling design.

## Performance:
- Shall include visible spectrum image sensors greater than 30 FPS, and 1/2 inch in sensor's diagonal size.
- Main sensor may have ≈24mm focus length, magnified sensor may have focus length ≥85mm (focus length are defined with 35mm equivalent focal length).

## Manufacturing & Maintenece Process Technology:
