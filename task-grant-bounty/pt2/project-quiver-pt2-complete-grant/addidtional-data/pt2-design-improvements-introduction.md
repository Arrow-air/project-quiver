- Reduce amount of screws (Three sould be enough).
- Reduce weight if possible.
- Optimized design for printing without support.

### 2.

- Create cutouts in the 100x30x2 aluminum profile so the chamfers on the bottom plate are no longer needed.
- The general cutouts in the profile can be optimized for weight reduction.

### 3.

- Make a small change in the design, so that the pin is not overhanging the edge.

### 4.

- Reduce weight (material thickness can be reduced).

### 5.

- Reduce weight with additional cutouts.

### 6.

- Reduce weight with additional cutouts (mind the sealing to the PCB! We can cover some holes with the 3D print that is under the PCB).

### 7.

- Reduce weight (Add cutouts to all sides of the square tubes).

### 8.

- Create PCB that integrates function of the battery connector, fuse, solid state relais

### 9.

- Create clip with a small spring for easy opening. Only 3D print is too stiff.

### 10.

- Add seal around the lid outside edge.

### 11.
