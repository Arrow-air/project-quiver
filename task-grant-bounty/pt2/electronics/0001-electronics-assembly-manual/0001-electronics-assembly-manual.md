### Step 15: Screw the FC on top of the Mateksys PDB and create the FC wiring

- Parts you need in this step: Mateksys H743 Slim V3, 4x M3 distance adapter (10mm), 4x plastic screws and nuts
- Screw the flight controller with the distance adapters on top of the Matekys PDB. Make sure the soft anti-vibration pads are added to the holes of the FC. Use plastic screws
- To connect the FC to the main PCB, wires are soldered to the upper pads of the FC. These wires attach to the two SMD connectors on the left and right side of the FC. It's not recommended to reproduce this assembly. If you need to do it, please look at the schematics to solder the wires to the corresponding connector pin
