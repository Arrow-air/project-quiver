## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To work with this repository, ensure you have:

* Git and Make installed
* Terraform (if provisioning infrastructure)
* Any language/toolchain dependencies required by files in `src/`

### Basic Usage

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arrow-air/project-quiver.git
cd project-quiver
```

Run any available automation (if defined in `Makefile`):

```bash
make help
# or specific targets like:
# make setup
# make test
```

> 📌 *Note: specific Makefile targets or Terraform steps may depend on internal conventions — consult `Makefile` and `.terraform_init` directly for more.*

## 📄 Documentation

All project-level documentation is located in the [`docs/`](docs/) folder. Key resources may include:

* Engineering reports
* Payload specifications
* Interface definitions
* Phase planning and reviews
* Meeting Notes and Recordings

Refer to filenames inside that folder for phase-specific progress (e.g., `PT1-Engineering-Report.md`).
