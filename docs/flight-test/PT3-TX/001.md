Aircraft Designation: QVR-PT-US02B

## 2. Test Conditions

Weather Condition: Clear

Temperature: 27.5 C

Wind Speed / Direction: 3 kts 122 

Humidity: 53%

Visibility: Clear

## 3. Test Aim / Procedure

### 3.1. Test Aim

- Moderate vibration existed during the last flight
  - Try the harmonic notch filter
- Tune the aircraft and try position hold mode  

### 3.2. Test Plan

- Will start with simple flights with little maneuvers
- Turn on the harmonic notch filter
- Tune the aircraft between legs based on the performance on each flight  

## 4. Preflight Checklist

### 4.1. Airframe Inspection

- [x] Visual check (no cracks, loose fasteners, damage) 

- [x] Structural mounting points (battery, payload) secure

### 4.2. Propulsion / Power System

- [x] Propeller(s) securely fastened, free of damage

- [x] Battery charge adequate. Battery Voltage: 58.6 V

### 4.3. Avionics / Electronics

- [x] Check all physical connections on the PCB and Pixhawk.

- [x] Contactor working smoothly

- [x] All pre-flight checks OK on the ground station.

- [x] RC remote & telemetry connections stable

### 4.4. Pilot Notes

- [x] Flight plan reviewed

- [x] IMSAFE 

## 5. Flight Test

### 5.1. Ground Run:

- Arm the vehicle

- Give 20% throttle input

- Observe the ground station for any errors, propellers are spinning with similar speeds in the right directions

- [x] No errors on ground station

- [ ] Propellers spinning with similar speeds
  = No, mostly due to the ground not being level

- [x] Propellers spinning in the right directions

- [x] Battery charge adequate. Battery voltage after ground run: 58.5 V
