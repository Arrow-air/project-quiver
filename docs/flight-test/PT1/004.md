## 3. Test Aim / Procedure

### 3.1. Test Aim
This test will be to validate the repaired aircraft and test the new PID gains.

### 3.2. Test Plan
- Test the contactor control
- Conduct a ground run and evaluate the aircraft structure
- Take off in stabilized mode, then test the new PID gains.

## 4. Preflight Checklist
### 4.1. Airframe Inspection

- [x] Visual check (no cracks, loose fasteners, damage) 

- [x] Structural mounting points (battery, payload) secure

Photos from the airframe, details where necessary

### 4.2. Propulsion / Power System

- [x] Propeller(s) securely fastened, free of damage

- [x] Battery charge adequate. Battery Voltage: 59.1V

### 4.3. Avionics / Electronics

- [x] Check all physical connections on the PCB and Pixhawk.

- [x] Contactor working smoothly

- [x] All pre-flight checks OK on the ground station.

- [x] RC remote & telemetry connections stable

### 4.4. Pilot Notes

- [x] Flight plan reviewed

- [x] IMSAFE 
 
Anything missing on the aircraft, anything that doesn't feel right

## 5. Flight Test

### 5.1. Ground Run:
- Arm the vehicle
- Give 20% throttle input
- Observe the ground station for any errors, propellers are spinning with similar speeds in the right directions

- [ ] No errors on ground station

- [ ] Propellers spinning with similar speeds

- [ ] Propellers spinning in the right directions

- [ ] Battery charge adequate. Battery voltage after ground run: 

### 5.2. Flight Test:

**Leg 1**
- With the original PID gains
- Conduct a ground run
- Take off in stabilized mode
- Test aircraft performance and stability
- Test position hold mode
