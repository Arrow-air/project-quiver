Date / Time: 2025-03-22 12:00 CST

Location: Balmorhea, TX

Pilot in Command: Thomas Garrison

Flight Crew / Observers:

Aircraft Designation: Quiver PT1

## 2. Test Conditions
Weather Condition: Clear

Temperature: 22C

Wind Speed / Direction: 260 14kts

Humidity: 6%

Visibility: 10sm

## 3. Test Aim / Procedure

### 3.1. Test Aim
The aim of the tests will be to work towards a comfortable short waypoint mission.

### 3.2. Test Plan
- Take off in stabilized mode, evaluate vibration and any other issues
- Conduct a test flight for magfit.
- Try improving the ground oscillation
- If the aircraft is performing well, try a short waypoint mission

## 4. Preflight Checklist
### 4.1. Airframe Inspection

- [x] Visual check (no cracks, loose fasteners, damage) 

- [x] Structural mounting points (battery, payload) secure

Photos from the airframe, details where necessary
- We reinstalled the landing feet and modified the battery connector PCB so that it extends an extra 6mm to make better contact with the battery.

### 4.2. Propulsion / Power System

- [x] Propeller(s) securely fastened, free of damage

- [x] Battery charge adequate. Battery Voltage: 58.9V

### 4.3. Avionics / Electronics

- [x] Check all physical connections on the PCB and Pixhawk.

- [x] Contactor working smoothly

- [x] All pre-flight checks OK on the ground station.

- [x] RC remote & telemetry connections stable

### 4.4. Pilot Notes

- [x] Flight plan reviewed

- [x] IMSAFE 
 
Anything missing on the aircraft, anything that doesn't feel right

## 5. Flight Test

### 5.1. Ground Run:
- Arm the vehicle
- Give 20% throttle input
- Observe the ground station for any errors, propellers are spinning with similar speeds in the right directions

- [ ] No errors on ground station

- [ ] Propellers spinning with similar speeds

- [ ] Propellers spinning in the right directions

- [ ] Battery charge adequate. Battery voltage after ground run: 

### 5.2. Flight Test:
- We adjusted the parameters to have better control over the camera and gimbal.

**Leg 1**
- Reduced yaw P and increased yaw D gains

#### Flight Feeling & Observations
- There was still a very noticeable vibration on the ground
- The aircraft flew well in flight

#### Pilot Actions/Inputs
- Switched to position hold mode in flight.

#### Aircraft Behavior
- In flight yaw re-alignement after takeoff

#### Flight Plan Achievement
- Stable flight

#### Recommendations
- Consider further review of gains
- Consider increasing the landing gear stiffness

**Leg 2**
- Takeoff in altitude hold mode
- Long flight in postition hold mode for magnetic data

#### Flight Feeling & Observations
- The aircraft is handling well
- Gimbal camera is looking good

#### Pilot Actions/Inputs
- Yaw 360, pitch and roll inputs
-

#### Aircraft Behavior
- Good takeoff and landing

#### Flight Plan Achievement
- More data for magfit

#### Pixhawk Logs

**Leg 3**
- Updated compass offsets with data from previous flight
- Conducted a few takeoffs and landings in altitude hold and position hold mode

#### Flight Feeling & Observations
- The aircraft is stable and holds a good heading in flight
- It gets an incorrect heading on the ground, but our cell phone compassess are showing the same error

#### Aircraft Behavior
- Stable takeoff in position hold mode, despite in flight yaw corrections

#### Flight Plan Achievement
- Ready for automated missions
