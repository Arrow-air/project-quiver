# Flight Log Review Summary – Project Quiver PT1

All available flight test logs for Project Quiver – Prototype 1 (PT1) have been manually reviewed individually. Each log file was carefully sorted and examined, with specific attention paid to the following aspects of each flight:

- Flight modes and their transitions  
- Flight duration and maneuvers  
- Vibration levels  
- GPS performance  
- EKF status and resets  
- Battery voltage and ESC readings  
- Flight controller behavior  
- Motor output trends  
- Additional general observations  

Key findings and observations were documented for future detailed investigation. The outcomes of this preliminary analysis are summarized in the table below, and recurring issues identified across multiple test logs are outlined here for deeper analysis.

## Issues Identified for Further Investigation

### 1. ESC0 Voltage Discrepancy  
In all examined flights, the voltage reading from **ESC0** consistently appears approximately **0.5V lower** than that of the other ESCs and the main battery voltage. This may indicate a **sensor offset or measurement error**, and further investigation is required to confirm its cause and impact.

### 2. Motor Output Divergence  
In some tests, particularly **while on the ground** and occasionally during **yaw inputs in flight**, motor outputs show **significant divergence** and in a small number of tests **hitting the motor limits**. These deviations may point to control imbalance or tuning inconsistencies.

### 3. Ground Resonance on Landing  
Ground resonance phenomena were observed during **landings**, particularly during the **March 22, 2025** tests. This effect was **mostly seen in AUTO mode** and **to a lesser extent in POS mode**. These events should be reviewed in connection with landing gear dynamics and control system behavior near touchdown. 

### 4. Oscillations and Tracking Deficiency in POS and AUTO Modes  
Minor **oscillatory behavior** was noted in **Position Hold (POS)** and **AUTO** modes. Additionally, it was observed that **actual control parameters do not follow the target values as precisely as in STABILIZE mode**. A noticeable **altitude loss during the deceleration phase** suggests that both the **inner-most and outer-loop controllers** may require **further tuning**, which can be effectively performed using the existing flight test data. Although it appears to be better in the later tests, a suitable gain set should be utilized.

### 5. EKF Yaw Resets  
**EKF yaw resets** were detected in **every test log**. While some yaw resets may occur under normal conditions, this recurring behavior warrants further analysis to ensure there is **no underlying issue being masked**, such as magnetic interference, poor GPS heading initialization, or insufficient yaw observability.

### 6. Yaw Reference Initialization Offset  
In a small number of tests, the **initial yaw reference value** was found to be slightly offset from the **actual yaw angle**. Although observed infrequently, this inconsistency should be examined to ensure proper heading alignment during mission-critical operations.
