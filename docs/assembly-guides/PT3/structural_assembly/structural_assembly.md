## Tool List

- You need the following tools:
  - Allen key set
  - Wrench set
  - Cordless screwdriver or drill press
  - Chamfering drill bit for 3mm holes
  - Riveting tool
  - Adhesive application tool
  - Loctite
  - Adhesive (for aluminum parts). Note: The adhesive is mostly to reduce vibrations. It's not really needed for structural robustness. The additional strength is just a positive additional point.
  - Cleaning agent
- Check if all the necessary parts are there



If you assembled it right your structure should look almost like the following picture.
