# Quiver Maintenance Guide

**Platform:** Quiver Dev-Kit
**Class:** Heavy-Lift Multipurpose UAV (<25 kg MTOW)

## General Maintenance Principles

Maintenance operation is a necessary way to discover potential problems in each aircraft system, reduce the failure rate, and keep the aircraft operating in the best performance condition. It is also an important way to ensure the aircraft can adapt to certain extreme environments.

If you don't have specific tools or confidence to perform a maintenance operation, starting with a visual observation is a good practice. Share your discoveries with your team or professional personnel.

## Subsystems Maintenance Checklist

Each subsystem affects the necessary functions, performance, and safety of the aircraft. Maintenance personnel should pay close attention to the specific parts listed below.

### 1. Motor Arm Assembly

| Component | Inspection Check | Potential Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Propellers** | Check for cracks, fractures, or surface burrs. | Harmful vibration; cracks may spread leading to a crash. |
| **Propeller Clamp** | Ensure screws are tight and secure. | Vibration; risk of propeller falling off. |
| **Integrated Motor** | Check rotor case for cuts, notches, or deformation. | Coil damage, overheating, or fire risk due to stator collision. |
| **Motor Mount** | Verify arm mounting slot screws are tight. | Motor unit tilting causing unstable flight performance. |
| **Arm Connectors** | Check folding joint screws for play/looseness. | Harmful vibration and reduced flight stability. |
| **Arm Tube** | Inspect Carbon Fiber for cracks, fractures, or burrs. | Tube breakage during high-stress maneuvers. |

### 2. Cockpit Structure Assembly

| Component | Inspection Check | Potential Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Enclosure** | Verify screw tightness and overall case integrity. | Structural failure or component exposure. |
| **Top Lid** | Check hinge movement and latch security. | Lid opening in flight. |
| **Battery Interface** | Inspect latch slot for cracks or deformation. | Battery falling off; difficult insertion causing insecure locking. |
| **Connector Cut-Out** | Check for deformation around the connector opening. | Poor electrical connection; invisible overheating signs. |
| **Battery Bay** | Check slide rails for dust, grease, or cracks. | Battery shifting in flight; difficult insertion or power loss. |
| **Structural Fasteners** | Check general airframe screws for tightness. | General structural integrity loss. |

### 3. Electrical Components

| Component | Inspection Check | Potential Risk |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **External Sensors** | Check mounts for cracks or loose screws. | Sensor tilting causing Flight Control errors or camera malfunction. |
| **Sensor Cabling** | Ensure cables are tight and not blocking sensors. | Obstruction of critical sensors. |
| **Main Power Connector** | Inspect for dust, debris, or pitting on pins. | Reduced lifespan, short circuits, or total power loss. |
| **Battery Latch** | Check for broken latches or lost spring tension. | Battery shifting during maneuvers leading to power loss. |

## Tools Requirement

There are generally no strict requirements on tool brands, but using tools with correct specifications helps extend equipment life.

:::warning
**WARNING:**
Always acknowledge the user manual before using your tools.

### Always-Prepared Tools (Field Kit)

Recommended to be carried at all times for operations.

| Item | Requirement | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pliers** | Narrow / Thin | Modifying cables, connectors, and nuts in tight spots. |
| **Hex Wrench Set** | L-Shape, Metric, Ball-end | Accessing fasteners in both open and narrow locations. |
| **Brush** | Non-conductive fiber | Safely cleaning electronic components. |
| **Rag / Towels** | Non-extra-thin | Cleaning grease or water drops. |
| **Personal Device** | PC / Tablet, USB-C | Ground diagnostics and configuration software. |

:::info
**REMINDER:**
For hex wrenches and fasteners, always confirm correct sizes with the "Structural Assembly Guide".

### Additional Tools (Workshop)

Recommended for the maintenance center for deep cleaning and analysis.

| Item | Requirement | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Brushes** | Various sizes | Cleaning narrow locations. |
| **Compressed Air** | High efficiency | High-efficiency dusting of avionics. |
| **Multimeter** | Standard | Electrical troubleshooting. |
| **Fasteners** | Matched specs | Replacement screws/nuts. |
| **Consumables** | Tape, Velcro, Zip ties | Cable management and temporary fixing. |
| **Adhesives** | Non-corrosive | Fixing enclosure fractures. |

## Regular Maintenance

### Before & After Flight

* **Before Flight:** Perform visual checks after assembly and before heading out.
* **After Flight:** Inspect after every landing and at the end of the workday.

### Environment Conditions

* **Rain:** Clean and dry the drone and transport case immediately.
* **Dust:** Clean the battery bay, gimbal camera, and other recesses.
* **Chemicals:** Clean pesticide or chemical contamination immediately.

### Hour Cycles

* **15 Hours:** Check harnessing connection security.
* **50 Hours:** Clean Flight Controller cockpit; measure and tighten structural screws.
* **100 Hours:** Full structural audit (recommended).

## Troubleshooting & Unscheduled Maintenance

### Abnormal Behavior

* **Loose Components:** Look for visible deformation, "glitches" in surface texture, or changes in friction/touch feeling.
* **Irregular Response:** Listen for "bad sounds" or note any lack of response/superfluous behavior.

### After Impact & Accident

* **Heavy Landing:** Check structural joints and electrical connections.
* **Tree Contact:** Check propellers for damage; inspect wiring and antennas for cuts.
